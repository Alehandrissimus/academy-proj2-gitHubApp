Developed an application for Github, with the following functionality:

Authorization<br />
User screen: the screen should have his avatar, name, list of repositories, with the ability to go to project details<br />
Project screen: the screen should have a list of contributors, readMe, and a list of issues, with the ability to go to details<br />
Screen issue: author, title, content, list of comments, the ability to add emotion to the comment)<br />
Search for users, with the ability to open the user profile<br />

The team must have a code review. All changes to the main branch should be made only through the pool request (pull request / merge 
request) from the feature of the branches.

Preparation
A separate repository in GitHub is created for the project with a name corresponding to the topic. You can use another GitHub account. 
Give access to colleagues from your team. Do not push directly to the main branch, it should be read-only.
